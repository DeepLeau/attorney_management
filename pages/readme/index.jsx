          This documentation outlines the steps I followed to build this application. It covers
          everything from the initial planning to the final implementation. The goal is to provide a
          clear understanding of the development process.

          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
            Before starting the coding process, I prepared a detailed plan for the application. I
            took notes of important points on Notion and asked ChatGPT to create a detailed action
            plan to guide me through the development process.
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
            I then coded the <code>&lt;AttorneyManagement&gt;</code> component which provided me
            with a global view of how the application should look.

          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
            Following the design steps outlined in Notion, I started by developing the entire admin
            section front-end using fake data by creating objects directly in React.

            üõ†Ô∏è Back-End Development with MongoDB and Mongoose
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
            After completing the front-end, I tackled the back-end. This was my first time working
            with MongoDB and Mongoose; I had only done a small project with it back in school. I'm
            more familiar with Prisma and PostgreSQL, but I managed well and plan to continue using
            MongoDB in my future projects.

            ‚öôÔ∏è State Management with MobX
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
            MobX was another new experience for me. I successfully integrated observers, and some
            data is handled in real-time. However, I couldn‚Äôt achieve real-time updates across
            multiple devices or tabs when data is modified. This is a feature I'd like to add in the
            future.
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
            On the other hand, every time I modify, create, or delete data on my page, I can see the
            changes in real-time without needing to reload the page.

            üîê Authentication with NextAuth
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
            I then added a connection system using NextAuth, which I am familiar with. I followed
            this documentation to adapt it to MongoDB:
            <MuiLink
              href="https://www.mongodb.com/developer/languages/typescript/nextauthjs-authentication-mongodb/"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              sx={{ textDecoration: 'none', color: '#3f51b5', fontWeight: 'bold' }}
            >
              NextAuth.js with MongoDB
            </MuiLink>
            .
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
            No real complications arose; it was straightforward, and the documentation even explains
            how to encrypt passwords with bcryptjs, which was very cool.
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
            I didn‚Äôt add GitHub or other OAuth connections; I kept it simple, but I could have done
            it easily with NextAuth.
          </Typography>

            üíÖ Styling and User Interface
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
            I then maximized the styling of my application. I created a user-facing front-end with a
            search function for attorneys where all data is counted, and in the pricing grid, we can
            also search by court, county, or violation.
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
            This part is accessible to non-logged-in users. To access the admin area and modify
            attorney details or pricing grids, you need to log in. You can also create an account on&nbsp;
            <Link href="/register">localhost:3000/register</Link>.
